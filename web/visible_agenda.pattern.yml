  Meetings tend to wander unless there is an agenda.  Putting it on the wall allows everyone to take ownership of it and of keeping the meeting on track. 
details: 
  Chris Simms has an excel template that looks like this-
  |agenda item|goal|technique|how long|start time|
  ||||||

  It calculates start time.  He notices that he works with "how long" in planning, but in the meeting, he works with "start time"
