People need to feel heard.  But often trying to meet this need comes in direct conflict with moving forward in a discussion.  By using gestures to express agreement and readiness to talk, individuals find another non disruptive outlet to be heard and the group as a whole gets a better understanding of who has been waiting to talk for a while.

The three gestures that I have seen used are :

* "I'd like to say something"
* "I agree"
* "That person has been waiting to talk for a while"

In larger groups, people often start talking over each other or dominating conversations.  When this happens, have the group use gestures to indicate readiness to talk and agreement.  

This helps keeps people from talking over each other, and makes speaking up more accessible to people who have slower "lag" times
