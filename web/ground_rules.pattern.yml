summary: Guide the group to agreeing to ground rules to guide their discussion.
details:
  The most effective authority in a group discussion comes from the group itself.  Each ground rule is an agreement that everyone shares and gives you as a facilitator authority to do your job in guiding the discussion to its goals.
  
  Also, the group will often butt against their rules.  In the heat of the moment, it's hard and often counter productive to make a rule and agree to it.  When you have agreed upon rules beforehand, people are much more welcome to being gently reminded
  
  An additional thing that often happens is the group will begin self policing.  When they made and agreed to their rules, they feel like they have the authority to enforce them.  This makes everything work better and keeps the facilitator from being the "bad guy"
  
  Let group come up with rules.
