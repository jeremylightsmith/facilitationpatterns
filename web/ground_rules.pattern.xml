Certain rules and patterns of activity can be hugely beneficial to group dynamics.  Guide the group to agreeing on some [ground_rules] to guide their discussion.

<example>
"Before we get started, let's set some ground rules.  It seems like we only have a limited amount of time.  To get the most out of our time, can we agree to only have [one_conversation]?"
"How would everyone feel about keeping all laptops off of the table?"

The most effective authority in a group discussion comes from the group itself.  Each ground rule is an agreement that everyone shares and gives you as a facilitator authority to do your job in guiding the discussion to its goals.

The group will often butt against their rules.  In the heat of the moment, it's hard and often counter productive to make a rule and agree to it.  When you have agreed upon rules beforehand, people are much more welcome to being gently reminded

Often the group will begin self policing on its own.  When they make and agree to their rules, they feel like they have the authority to enforce them.  This makes everything work better and keeps the facilitator from being the "bad guy".

Let group come up with rules.

*No cell phones or computers* - one of the best rules ever
*We are going to try to be on time* - gives you the power to cut off anyone
*We're not going to worry so much about being on time* - allows you to relax as a time keeper
[one_conversation]
[no_stories]
